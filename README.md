<h1>Mine VRSC (Linux)</h1>

Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Debian, Fedora

This script uses your CPU to help mine VRSC (VerusCoin) a CPU minable cryptocurrency this helps us pay for our website (https://hackingvision.com) and also fund cybersecurity projects. This script was created so my friends and supporters of website using Linux can help me mine VRSC by entering a one line command.

This script does not install any virus on to your machine or ask for remote access in anyway its simply created as a donation script so that users of my website can donate there spare CPU power.

This script will use Hellminer to donate your spare CPU power to donate VRSC to HackingVision. 

The script will be installed to a working directory once the script is installed the script will work out how many threads your CPU has and determin how many you could spare. The scirpt will then assign random worker ID and start to mine VRSC.
 
<h2>Why do we want your CPU's idle power?</h2>

Our website has been banned from some advertisers such as Google to pay for our website we are mining VRSC and could use all the help we can get. Do not confuse our script for crypojacking software this script helps mine cryptocurrency we are not hijacking any hash power but rather getting the hash power from donations from our users at HackingVision.com.

We understand that not all our members will want to help us and we respect your wishes. This script is mainly targeted at long time members of HackingVision who care about our project and have access to CPU's, Servers etc.

Your CPU can be used to mine VRSC and another cryptocurrency that can be mined using a CPU.
